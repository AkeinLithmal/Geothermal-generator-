1. Water → Steam:

Purified water is pumped into the underground heat chamber (150 °C+ zone).

The chamber turns it into high-pressure steam.



2. Steam Jet → Turbine:

Steam escapes through a narrow nozzle — this increases velocity and pressure (Bernoulli’s principle ).

The fast-moving steam spins a turbine, generating electricity.



3. Steam Recovery:

The exhaust steam hits an inclined condenser plate, where it cools and turns back into water droplets.

The droplets slide down into a collection tank.



4. Closed-loop refill:

Once the tank is full, a valve or pump sends the water back to the underground chamber, starting the cycle again.
